It's been awhile since I touched this project but I'm back to work some more on it. Currently I've been working on the JS list of fish which I will upload today after this README update. It contains the fish in an object list which is what will be referenced when it outputs that data based on the month selected.

That's pretty much all for now but I hope to have more done within the week, hopefully the design! :relieved:

#### Fish Data Update
###### **Posted 10/03/18**

So this morning I went quickly over the current spreadsheet while doing some back and forth between sources. So I have updated the fishes that have specific end dates to their availability (ex, they can be caught until Sept 15th) and sorted out dates that have disrepency by going with the ones that have a majority across different sites. Still if there's any errors please feel free to open an issue to point it out and update the public spreadsheet.

Thanks and have a great day! :smiley:
